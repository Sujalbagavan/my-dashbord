Design Process
Figma Design:
The dashboard UI was designed in Figma with a focus on user experience and responsiveness.
The layout includes a navigation sidebar, customizable dashboard widgets, and a lead management section with dummy data.
A reporting tool for generating PDF/CSV reports is also integrated.
Feedback & Iteration:
After designing the UI, I shared it with friends and peers for feedback.
Several improvements were made based on their suggestions to enhance both aesthetics and functionality.

Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js for building the UI.
- Charting Library: Recharts for data visualization.
- Styling: CSS Modules for scoped and maintainable styles.
- Deployment: Deployed using Netlify for a fast and seamless experience.

Key Features
- Responsive Design: EzyMetrics is fully responsive, offering a smooth experience across devices from desktops to mobile phones.
- Customizable Widgets: The dashboard features customizable widgets to display metrics relevant to the user.
- Lead Management: A dedicated section for managing leads, with details accessible through modals.
- Analytics & Reporting: Easily generate PDF or CSV reports of the data.

Feedback and Improvements
This project has gone through several rounds of feedback and improvement:
- Feedback from peers helped refine the layout and usability.
- Changes were made to enhance responsiveness and optimize the overall user experience.

Alternative Solutions
While building this project, I explored a few alternative charting libraries:
- Chart.js: A widely used charting library, but I chose Recharts for its simplicity and better integration with React.
- D3.js: Another powerful library, though its steep learning curve made Recharts the preferred option for this project.
